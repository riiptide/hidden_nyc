            <h2>Do Drugs, Not Laundry</h2>
            <p>
              Hella tobacco and drug alcohol stores where black peoples are, architectural violence. Imagine you’re a kid in the Bronx or upper manhattan, you’re black, and you grow up surrounded by drug stores. You see people around you using drugs to cope, and you start to do the same. Drugs prevent people from living life on their own terms, and they are being pushed onto black communities. This perpetuates a cycle of stationary violence where people are born in a neighborhood, do drugs, succumb to addiction and living life paycheck to paycheck, selling stuff in pawn shops, and then they are not able to escape the bad neighborhood. A crafted system of pawn shops and drug shops keeps them segregated from the posh areas and in poverty. On the other hand, notice the amount of laundry shops on the upper east side. What does that do to a kid growing up? It’s practically screaming “pay to get your laundry done, your time is worth more than that.” Surrounded by private schools and banks, and you believe you are above laundry. Laundry is freeing, not trapping - by paying to get your laundry done, you free up time and space to do other stuff and climb whatever ladder you’re on. By paying for drugs, you sacrifice your time and space and fall deeper into whatever trap you’re in.

            <h2>30 Blocks North</h2>
            <p>
              Above and below 97th street transverse road might as well be Earth and Jupiter. The neighborhood demographic goes from 70% white below the road to 50% hispanic and 25% black right above. Property values and proportion of single family homes sharply decline. It’s a haunting contrast. NYC segregationist and redlining laws keeping races from mixing. Cite a segregationist policy.  Friends telling me don’t go above 97th street ever because it’s not safe… implicit in the message is You will get mugged, shot, assaulted, be the victim of violent crime. Did something horrible happen ? Or is it white people enforcing segregationist policies ? Any justification can be constructed, in defense of segregation and violence against another group. The shantytowns are naturally dirty, so infection spreads faster. Reference An infection of locality’: plague, pythogenesis and the poor in Bombay, how people made up stories and accusations to craft an invisible wall between the two communities. Reference anything about spatial violence and segregation to the edges of the city.  Black people live in an area that real estate areas wanna tear down, real estate contractors say oh this place is infected, we gotta tear it down.  The wall is held up by stories and fear mongering to the wealthy white collar New Yorkers, keeping them from ever crossing the boundary. However, I see a high school a couple blocks north of 97th street. You’re telling me a walk to a high school is unsafe? I wonder about the dreams and aspirations of the kids going to that high school. They dream of being bankers, doctors, and healers, perhaps in their own community, 30 blocks south, or away from NYC entirely. They have no idea that 30 blocks south, a software engineer is whispering to his friend about the dangers of going above 97th street. And the software engineers have no idea that 30 blocks north are people just like them with the same hopes and fears, except for the number of their block and the color of their skin.
